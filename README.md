📢 Social Media Caption Generator
This project is an AI-powered caption generator for social media platforms. It takes an input image and generates an appropriate, engaging caption using deep learning models.

🔍 Features
🧠 Uses pre-trained image captioning models (e.g., CNN + RNN / Transformer-based)

📸 Upload any image and get a creative caption

🎯 Ideal for influencers, marketers, and content creators

💻 Built using Python and Jupyter Notebook

🚀 How It Works
The image is processed and features are extracted using CNN (like InceptionV3 or ResNet).

Those features are passed to a trained language model (e.g., LSTM or Transformer).

The model generates a relevant caption based on learned patterns.
